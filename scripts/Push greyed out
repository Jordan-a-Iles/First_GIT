# For when the push icon is greyed out in Rstudio:

# 1. Open your console and navigate to your repo (GIT tab > More > Shell)
# 2. Make some commit
# 3. Make a push using -u (i.e. --set-upstream) flag, eg: git push origin master -u
# 4. Open Rstudio (or restart it if it was open while performing the previous step) and you'll see the push and pull icons are no longer greyed out.
